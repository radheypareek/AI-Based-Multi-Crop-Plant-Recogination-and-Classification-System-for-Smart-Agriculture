1. **Capture Crop Image:** Snap a photo of the affected plant leaf using your mobile device or camera.

3. **Gemini AI Analyzes:** System processes image and text, considers weather and soil data, and provides a diagnosis.
4. **Get Recommendations:** Instantly receive disease classification, severity levels, and step-by-step treatment options—all in your language.
